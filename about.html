            Building great public schools of joy and rigor that prepare all
            California students for success in college, career, community, and
            life.

          <h2>MISSION</h2>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            To meet parent, educator, and community need for great public school
            options by supporting and advocating for high quality non-profit
            charter schools and sharing their success throughout California’s
            public schools.

          <h2>OUR COMMITMENT TO EQUITY, OPPORTUNITY AND ACCESS</h2>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            As part of California’s public school family, CCSA embraces its
            history of being an advocacy organization advancing issues of social
            justice and civil rights. Our members and the teachers and
            administrators who serve in their schools value diversity in
            culture, gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age,
            disability, and perspective.
          </p>

          <p class="about__paragraph">
            While we seek to grow a movement that serves all students, all
            families, and all communities, we work with a special spirit of
            urgency to provide our most historically underserved and vulnerable
            students with the high quality public education they deserve. We
            join in common cause with those fighting both inside and outside of
            public education for greater equity, opportunity, and access for
            all.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="about__info">
          <h2>GET INVOLVED</h2>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            Charter public schools are driven by one common force: parents and
            students who want access to the best education for themselves and
            their children.
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            We help charter school parents, students and family members become
            leaders in their communities, uniting them in one powerful voice
            that fights for access to high-quality choices in California.
          </p>
          <p class="about__paragraph">
            These voices make a difference. Decision-makers hear our concerns
            and we make an impact on education policy across California. Parents
            and students are their own best advocates to speak out for their own
            rights.
