# University of Oregon Asssessment

As part of an assessment for a Web Developer position I created these two webpages. The color scheme and the images used were based off a branding guide that was provided. The designs were created by me with mockups made in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). 

Here is the link to the [site](https://chic-malabi-340ec1.netlify.app/).
